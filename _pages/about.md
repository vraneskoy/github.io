<p>ðŸ‘‹ I'm a senior student pursuing degrees in Mathematics and Chinese, with the intent to pursue a PhD in Mathematics, focusing on the Analysis and PDEs.<p>
<p>ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in mathematics (especially analysis and probability), machine learning, and participating in competitive events like math contests. :)<p>
<p>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently participating in a SMALL REU 2025 under supervision of Prof. Steven Miller, Prof. Alex Iosovich, and Prof. Eyvindur Ari Palsoon. This Fall I will be starting my work on my undergraduate honors thesis on Random Matricies with Prof. Mihai Stoichiu.<p>
