<p>ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a fourth-year student pursuing degrees in Mathematics and Chinese, with the intent to pursue a Ph.D. in Mathematics, focusing on Analysis and Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).<p>

<p>ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in mathematicsâ€”especially analysis and probabilityâ€”learning languages, machine learning, and participating in competitive events like math contests. :)<p>

<p>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently participating in the SMALL REU 2025 under the supervision of Prof. Steven Miller, Prof. Alex Iosevich, and Prof. Eyvindur Ari Palsson. This fall, I will begin work on my undergraduate honors thesis on random matrices with Prof. Mihai Stoiciu.<p>
